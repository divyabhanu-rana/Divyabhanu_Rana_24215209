## 📖 Theory

A **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** is a type of Feedforward Artificial Neural Network consisting of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Unlike a simple perceptron, an MLP can learn complex and non-linear relationships in data by using multiple hidden neurons and activation functions.

In this practical, the Iris dataset is used, which contains measurements of iris flowers belonging to three different species:

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Each flower is represented using four numerical features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The network learns patterns from these measurements and predicts the correct flower species.

The hidden layers use the **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** activation function to introduce non-linearity, while the output layer uses the **Softmax** activation function to generate probability scores for all three classes.

The model is trained using the **Adam optimizer** and the **Sparse Categorical Crossentropy** loss function, which is well-suited for multiclass classification problems where class labels are represented as integers.

## 🌍 Real-World Application

### Plant Species Classification

One practical application of Multi-Layer Perceptrons is **automatic plant species classification** in agriculture and environmental science.

Researchers often collect measurements such as:

- Leaf Length
- Leaf Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Stem Thickness

Instead of manually identifying plant species, these measurements can be supplied to a trained neural network.

The MLP analyzes the input features, identifies hidden patterns learned during training, and predicts the most probable plant species.

Such systems are useful for:

- Botanical Research
- Smart Agriculture
- Biodiversity Monitoring
- Forest Management
- Automated Plant Identification Apps

Although modern image-based plant classification commonly uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptrons remain an excellent choice when structured numerical features are available.
