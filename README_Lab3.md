## 📖 Theory

A **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** is one of the most fundamental architectures in Deep Learning. Unlike a single neuron or perceptron, an FNN contains multiple layers of interconnected neurons that can learn complex relationships within data.

The architecture consists of three main layers:

- **Input Layer** – Receives the input features.
- **Hidden Layer(s)** – Learns meaningful patterns and relationships from the data.
- **Output Layer** – Produces the final prediction.

During training, data flows from the input layer to the output layer (forward propagation). The prediction error is then calculated using a loss function, and the network updates its weights using **backpropagation** and an optimization algorithm such as Adam.

This learning process enables the network to continuously improve its predictions over multiple epochs.

## ⚙️ Code Concept

The implementation follows these steps:

1. Import NumPy and TensorFlow.
2. Create the AND gate dataset.
3. Define the Feedforward Neural Network using the Sequential API.
4. Add a hidden Dense layer with the ReLU activation function.
5. Add an output Dense layer with the Sigmoid activation function.
6. Compile the model using:
   - Adam Optimizer
   - Binary Crossentropy Loss
7. Train the model for multiple epochs.
8. Evaluate the model's accuracy.
9. Predict outputs for all possible AND gate inputs.

TensorFlow automatically performs forward propagation, computes the loss, applies backpropagation, and updates the network weights during training.

## 🌍 Real-World Application

### Handwritten Digit Recognition

One of the most common applications of Feedforward Neural Networks is **handwritten digit recognition**, where computers automatically identify digits written by humans.

Consider an image of a handwritten number. Before being processed, the image is converted into numerical pixel values. These pixel values become the input features for the neural network.

The workflow is as follows:

1. The **input layer** receives the pixel values of the image.
2. The **hidden layer** learns important visual patterns such as edges, curves, and shapes.
3. The **output layer** predicts which digit (0–9) is present in the image.

For example, if a handwritten image of the digit **"7"** is given as input, the network analyzes the learned patterns and assigns the highest probability to the output neuron representing the digit **7**.

This technology is widely used in:

- Bank cheque processing
- Postal code recognition
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Automated form processing
- Educational examination systems
- Digitizing handwritten records

Although modern image recognition systems primarily use **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for higher accuracy, Feedforward Neural Networks provide the fundamental understanding of how neural networks learn patterns from data. Many advanced deep learning architectures are built upon the same principles demonstrated in this experiment.
